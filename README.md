Project can help you to solve some difficulties in process of achieving goals.
There is two types of user's roles.
The first role is for a user who wants to achieve some goal. This role's name is "achiever". User has to set the schedule when he/she will do his/her actions and he/she has to set a guarantee sum of money that he/she will be ready to lose, if he/she don't confirm his/her acts.
The second role is for a user that observe "achiever". This role's name is "observer". Observer has to check that achiever follows his/her schedule and reports about his/her acts on time. If achiever doesn't report on time, observer will have an opportunity to fine him. This will be a good motivation for achiever to follow his/her original plan.
Project is based on Ethereum contracts.
